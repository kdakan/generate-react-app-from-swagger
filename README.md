# generate-react-app-from-swagger
How to generate a full-featured React app from a restful Swagger API definition (including routing, mock and real api, mock data, validation, auth, internationalization, and an optional Redux layer)

(Work in progress, will soon add a tutorial as well as the code)

## Exploring the example React app we want to generate 
## Exploring the generic backend search/query library to make life easier on us 
## Swagger json structure
## Exposing validation rules from the backend API
## Mapping Rest API routes and resources to the React project structure
## Deciding whether to use or leave out the optional Redux layer
## Parsing parent/child and lookup relations between Rest API resources (entities)
## Designing the navigation structure between components for a good UX
## Designing the React app architecture, main layers & component types, smart (container) & dummy (presentational) components 
## Building common (shared) controls, like sidebar navigation, spinner, grid, form layout manager, breadcrumbs, tabs, cards & inputs
## Building common utility libraries, like validator & auth manager
## Generating routes and sidebar navigation React code for all Rest API resources (entities)
## Generating React code for real and mock api layer for each Rest API resource (entity)
## Generating mock data json for each Rest API resource (entity)
## Generating validation React code for each Rest API resource (entity)
## Generating search page component React code for each Rest API resource (entity)
## Generating CRUD page component React code for each Rest API resource (entity)
## Generating panel and list component React code for each nested Rest API resource (entity)
## Generating cascading lookup React code for each Rest API resource (entity)
## Generating internationalization resources for each module
